<H2>
What Is OpenGL?</H2>
OpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. This interface consists
of about 120 distinct commands, which you use to specify the objects and
operations needed to produce interactive three-dimensional applications.
<P>OpenGL is designed to work efficiently even if the computer that displays
the graphics you create isn't the computer that runs your graphics program.
This might be the case if you work in a networked computer environment
where many computers are connected to one another by wires capable of carrying
digital data. In this situation, the computer on which your program runs
and issues OpenGL drawing commands is called the client, and the computer
that receives those commands and performs the drawing is called the server.
The format for transmitting OpenGL commands (called the <I>protocol</I>)
from the client to the server is always the same, so OpenGL programs can
work across a network even if the client and server are different kinds
of computers. If an OpenGL program isn't running across a network, then
there's only one computer, and it is both the client and the server.
<P>OpenGL is designed as a streamlined, hardware-independent interface
to be implemented on many different hardware platforms. To achieve these
qualities, no commands for performing windowing tasks or obtaining user
input are included in OpenGL; instead, you must work through whatever windowing
system controls the particular hardware you're using. Similarly, OpenGL
doesn't provide high-level commands for describing models of three-dimensional
objects. Such commands might allow you to specify relatively complicated
shapes such as automobiles, parts of the body, airplanes, or molecules.
With OpenGL, you must build up your desired model from a small set of geometric
primitive - points, lines, and polygons. (A sophisticated library that
provides these features could certainly be built on top of OpenGL - in
fact, that's what Open Inventor is. See "OpenGL-related Libraries" for
more information about Open Inventor.)
<P>Now that you know what OpenGL <I>doesn't</I> do, here's what it <I>does</I>
do. Take a look at the color plates - they illustrate typical uses of OpenGL.
They show the scene on the cover of this book, drawn by a computer (which
is to say, <I>rendered</I>) in successively more complicated ways. The
following paragraphs describe in general terms how these pictures were
made.
<UL>Figure J-1 shows the entire scene displayed as a wireframe model -
that is, as if all the objects in the scene were made of wire. Each line
of wire corresponds to an edge of a primitive (typically a polygon). For
example, the surface of the table is constructed from triangular polygons
that are positioned like slices of pie.
<P>Note that you can see portions of objects that would be obscured if
the objects were solid rather than wireframe. For example, you can see
the entire model of the hills outside the window even though most of this
model is normally hidden by the wall of the room. The globe appears to
be nearly solid because it's composed of hundreds of colored blocks, and
you see the wireframe lines for all the edges of all the blocks, even those
forming the back side of the globe. The way the globe is constructed gives
you an idea of how complex objects can be created by assembling lower-level
objects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Figure J-2 shows a <I>depth-cued</I> version of the same wireframe scene.
Note that the lines farther from the eye are dimmer, just as they would
be in real life, thereby giving a visual cue of depth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Figure J-3 shows an <I>antialiased</I> version of the wireframe scene.
Antialiasing is a technique for reducing the jagged effect created when
only portions of neighboring pixels properly belong to the image being
drawn. Such jaggies are usually the most visible with near-horizontal or
near-vertical lines.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Figure J-4 shows a <I>flat-shaded</I> version of the scene. The objects
in the scene are now shown as solid objects of a single color. They appear
"flat" in the sense that they don't seem to respond to the lighting conditions
in the room, so they don't appear smoothly rounded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Figure J-5 shows a <I>lit, smooth-shaded</I> version of the scene. Note
how the scene looks much more realistic and three-dimensional when the
objects are shaded to respond to the light sources in the room; the surfaces
of the objects now look smoothly rounded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Figure J-6 adds <I>shadows</I> and <I>textures</I> to the previous version
of the scene. Shadows aren't an explicitly defined feature of OpenGL (there
is no "shadow command"), but you can create them yourself using the techniques
described in Chapter 13 . Texture mapping allows you to apply a two-dimensional
texture to a three-dimensional object. In this scene, the top on the table
surface is the most vibrant example of texture mapping. The walls, floor,
table surface, and top (on top of the table) are all texture mapped.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Figure J-7 shows a <I>motion-blurred</I> object in the scene. The sphinx
(or dog, depending on your Rorschach tendencies) appears to be captured
as it's moving forward, leaving a blurred trace of its path of motion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Figure J-8 shows the scene as it's drawn for the cover of the book from
a different viewpoint. This plate illustrates that the image really is
a snapshot of models of three-dimensional objects.</UL>
The next two color images illustrate yet more complicated visual effects
that can be achieved with OpenGL:
<UL>Figure J-9 illustrates the use of atmospheric effects (collectively
referred to as fog) to show the presence of particles in the air.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Figure J-10 shows the <I>depth-of-field effect</I>, which simulates
the inability of a camera lens to maintain all objects in a photographed
scene in focus. The camera focuses on a particular spot in the scene, and
objects that are significantly closer or farther than that spot are somewhat
blurred.</UL>
The color plates give you an idea of the kinds of things you can do with
the OpenGL graphics system. The next several paragraphs briefly describe
the order in which OpenGL performs the major graphics operations necessary
to render an image on the screen. Appendix A, "Order of Operations" describes
this order of operations in more detail.
<OL>Construct shapes from geometric primitives, thereby creating mathematical
descriptions of objects. (OpenGL considers points, lines, polygons, images,
and bitmaps to be primitives.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Arrange the objects in three-dimensional space and select the desired
vantage point for viewing the composed scene.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Calculate the color of all the objects. The color might be explicitly
assigned by the application, determined from specified lighting conditions,
or obtained by pasting a texture onto the objects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Convert the mathematical description of objects and their associated
color information to pixels on the screen. This process is called <I>rasterization</I>.</OL>
During these stages, OpenGL might perform other operations, such as eliminating
parts of objects that are hidden by other objects (the hidden parts won't
be drawn, which might increase performance). In addition, after the scene
is rasterized but just before it's drawn on the screen, you can manipulate
the pixel data if you want.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>
A Very Simple OpenGL Program</H2>
Because you can do so many things with the OpenGL graphics system, an OpenGL
program can be complicated. However, the basic structure of a useful program
can be simple: Its tasks are to initialize certain states that control
how OpenGL renders and to specify objects to be rendered.
<P>Before you look at an OpenGL program, let's go over a few terms. Rendering,
which you've already seen used, is the process by which a computer creates
images from models. These <I>models</I>, or objects, are constructed from
geometric primitives - points, lines, and polygons - that are specified
by their vertices.
<P>The final rendered image consists of pixels drawn on the screen; a pixel
- short for picture element - is the smallest visible element the display
hardware can put on the screen. Information about the pixels (for instance,
what color they're supposed to be) is organized in system memory into bitplanes.
A bitplane is an area of memory that holds one bit of information for every
pixel on the screen; the bit might indicate how red a particular pixel
is supposed to be, for example. The bitplanes are themselves organized
into a framebuffer, which holds all the information that the graphics display
needs to control the intensity of all the pixels on the screen.
<P>Now look at an OpenGL program. Example 1-1 renders a white rectangle
on a black background, as shown in Figure 1-1 .
<P><IMG SRC="figures/fig01-01.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" NOSAVE HEIGHT=269 WIDTH=251>
<P><B>Figure 1-1 : </B>A White Rectangle on a Black Background
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Example 1-1 : </B>A Simple OpenGL Program
<PRE>#include &lt;whateverYouNeed.h>

main() {

&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenAWindowPlease();

&nbsp;&nbsp; glClearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
&nbsp;&nbsp; glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
&nbsp;&nbsp; glColor3f(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
&nbsp;&nbsp; glOrtho(-1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0);&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; glBegin(GL_POLYGON);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glVertex2f(-0.5, -0.5);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glVertex2f(-0.5, 0.5);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glVertex2f(0.5, 0.5);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glVertex2f(0.5, -0.5);
&nbsp;&nbsp; glEnd();
&nbsp;&nbsp; glFlush();

&nbsp;&nbsp; KeepTheWindowOnTheScreenForAWhile();
}</PRE>
The first line of the <B>main()</B> routine opens a window on the screen:
The <B>OpenAWindowPlease()</B> routine is meant as a placeholder for a
window system-specific routine. The next two lines are OpenGL commands
that clear the window to black: <B>glClearColor()</B> establishes what
color the window will be cleared to, and <B>glClear()</B> actually clears
the window. Once the color to clear to is set, the window is cleared to
that color whenever <B>glClear()</B> is called. The clearing color can
be changed with another call to <B>glClearColor()</B>. Similarly, the <B>glColor3f()</B>
command establishes what color to use for drawing objects - in this case,
the color is white. All objects drawn after this point use this color,
until it's changed with another call to set the color.
<P>The next OpenGL command used in the program, <B>glOrtho()</B>, specifies
the coordinate system OpenGL assumes as it draws the final image and how
the image gets mapped to the screen. The next calls, which are bracketed
by <B>glBegin()</B> and <B>glEnd()</B>, define the object to be drawn -
in this example, a polygon with four vertices. The polygon's "corners"
are defined by the <B>glVertex2f()</B> commands. As you might be able to
guess from the arguments, which are (<I>x, y</I>) coordinate pairs, the
polygon is a rectangle.
<P>Finally, <B>glFlush()</B> ensures that the drawing commands are actually
executed, rather than stored in a buffer awaiting additional OpenGL commands.
The <B>KeepTheWindowOnTheScreenForAWhile()</B> placeholder routine forces
the picture to remain on the screen instead of immediately disappearing.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>
OpenGL Command Syntax</H2>
As you might have observed from the simple program in the previous section,
OpenGL commands use the prefix <B>gl</B> and initial capital letters for
each word making up the command name (recall <B>glClearColor()</B>, for
example). Similarly, OpenGL defined constants begin with GL_, use all capital
letters, and use underscores to separate words (like GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT).
<P>You might also have noticed some seemingly extraneous letters appended
to some command names (the <B>3f</B> in <B>glColor3f()</B>, for example).
It's true that the <B>Color</B> part of the command name is enough to define
the command as one that sets the current color. However, more than one
such command has been defined so that you can use different types of arguments.
In particular, the <B>3</B> part of the suffix indicates that three arguments
are given; another version of the <B>Color</B> command takes four arguments.
The <B>f</B> part of the suffix indicates that the arguments are floating-point
numbers. Some OpenGL commands accept as many as eight different data types
for their arguments. The letters used as suffixes to specify these data
types for ANSI C implementations of OpenGL are shown in Table 1-1 , along
with the corresponding OpenGL type definitions. The particular implementation
of OpenGL that you're using might not follow this scheme exactly; an implementation
in C++ or Ada, for example, wouldn't need to.

<P>Thus, the two commands
<PRE>glVertex2i(1, 3);
glVertex2f(1.0, 3.0);</PRE>
are equivalent, except that the first specifies the vertex's coordinates
as 32-bit integers and the second specifies them as single-precision floating-point
numbers.
<P>Some OpenGL commands can take a final letter <B>v</B>, which indicates
that the command takes a pointer to a vector (or array) of values rather
than a series of individual arguments. Many commands have both vector and
nonvector versions, but some commands accept only individual arguments
and others require that at least some of the arguments be specified as
a vector. The following lines show how you might use a vector and a nonvector
version of the command that sets the current color:
<PRE>glColor3f(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);

float color_array[] = {1.0, 0.0, 0.0};
glColor3fv(color_array);</PRE>
In the rest of this guide (except in actual code examples), OpenGL commands
are referred to by their base names only, and an asterisk is included to
indicate that there may be more to the command name. For example, <B>glColor*()</B>
stands for all variations of the command you use to set the current color.
If we want to make a specific point about one version of a particular command,
we include the suffix necessary to define that version. For example, <B>glVertex*v()</B>
refers to all the vector versions of the command you use to specify vertices.
<P>Finally, OpenGL defines the constant GLvoid; if you're programming in
C, you can use this instead of void.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>
OpenGL as a State Machine</H2>
OpenGL is a state machine. You put it into various states (or modes) that
then remain in effect until you change them. As you've already seen, the
current color is a state variable. You can set the current color to white,
red, or any other color, and thereafter every object is drawn with that
color until you set the current color to something else. The current color
is only one of many state variables that OpenGL preserves. Others control
such things as the current viewing and projection transformations, line
and polygon stipple patterns, polygon drawing modes, pixel-packing conventions,
positions and characteristics of lights, and material properties of the
objects being drawn. Many state variables refer to modes that are enabled
or disabled with the command <B>glEnable()</B> or <B>glDisable()</B>.
<P>Each state variable or mode has a default value, and at any point you
can query the system for each variable's current value. Typically, you
use one of the four following commands to do this: <B>glGetBooleanv(),
glGetDoublev()</B>, <B>glGetFloatv()</B>, or <B>glGetIntegerv()</B>. Which
of these commands you select depends on what data type you want the answer
to be given in. Some state variables have a more specific query command
(such as <B>glGetLight*()</B>, <B>glGetError()</B>, or <B>glGetPolygonStipple()</B>).
In addition, you can save and later restore the values of a collection
of state variables on an attribute stack with the <B>glPushAttrib()</B>
and <B>glPopAttrib()</B> commands. Whenever possible, you should use these
commands rather than any of the query commands, since they're likely to
be more efficient.
<P>The complete list of state variables you can query is found in Appendix
B . For each variable, the appendix also lists the <B>glGet*()</B> command
that returns the variable's value, the attribute class to which it belongs,
and the variable's default value.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>
OpenGL-related Libraries</H2>
OpenGL provides a powerful but primitive set of rendering commands, and
all higher-level drawing must be done in terms of these commands. Therefore,
you might want to write your own library on top of OpenGL to simplify your
programming tasks. Also, you might want to write some routines that allow
an OpenGL program to work easily with your windowing system. In fact, several
such libraries and routines have already been written to provide specialized
features, as follows. Note that the first two libraries are provided with
every OpenGL implementation, the third was written for this book and is
available using ftp, and the fourth is a separate product that's based
on OpenGL.
<UL>The OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) contains several routines that use
lower-level OpenGL commands to perform such tasks as setting up matrices
for specific viewing orientations and projections, performing polygon tessellation,
and rendering surfaces. This library is provided as part of your OpenGL
implementation. It's described in more detail in Appendix C and in the
<I>OpenGL
Reference Manual</I>. The more useful GLU routines are described in the
chapters in this guide, where they're relevant to the topic being discussed.
GLU routines use the prefix <B>glu</B>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>The OpenGL Extension to the X Window System (GLX) provides a means of
creating an OpenGL context and associating it with a drawable window on
a machine that uses the X Window System. GLX is provided as an adjunct
to OpenGL. It's described in more detail in both Appendix D and the <I>OpenGL
Reference Manual</I>. One of the GLX routines (for swapping framebuffers)
is described in "Animation." GLX routines use the prefix <B>glX</B>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>The <I>OpenGL Programming Guide</I> Auxiliary Library was written specifically
for this book to make programming examples simpler and yet more complete.
It's the subject of the next section, and it's described in more detail
in Appendix E . Auxiliary library routines use the prefix <B>aux</B>. "How
to Obtain the Sample Code" describes how to obtain the source code for
the auxiliary library.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Open Inventor is an object-oriented toolkit based on OpenGL that provides
objects and methods for creating interactive three-dimensional graphics
applications. Available from Silicon Graphics and written in C++, Open
Inventor provides pre-built objects and a built-in event model for user
interaction, high-level application components for creating and editing
three-dimensional scenes, and the ability to print objects and exchange
data in other graphics formats.</UL>

<H3>
The OpenGL Programming Guide Auxiliary Library</H3>
As you know, OpenGL contains rendering commands but is designed to be independent
of any window system or operating system. Consequently, it contains no
commands for opening windows or reading events from the keyboard or mouse.
Unfortunately, it's impossible to write a complete graphics program without
at least opening a window, and most interesting programs require a bit
of user input or other services from the operating system or window system.
In many cases, complete programs make the most interesting examples, so
this book uses a small auxiliary library to simplify opening windows, detecting
input, and so on.
<P>In addition, since OpenGL's drawing commands are limited to those that
generate simple geometric primitives (points, lines, and polygons), the
auxiliary library includes several routines that create more complicated
three-dimensional objects such as a sphere, a torus, and a teapot. This
way, snapshots of program output can be interesting to look at. If you
have an implementation of OpenGL and this auxiliary library on your system,
the examples in this book should run without change when linked with them.
<P>The auxiliary library is intentionally simple, and it would be difficult
to build a large application on top of it. It's intended solely to support
the examples in this book, but you may find it a useful starting point
to begin building real applications. The rest of this section briefly describes
the auxiliary library routines so that you can follow the programming examples
in the rest of this book. Turn to Appendix E for more details about these
routines.
<H4>
Window Management</H4>
Three routines perform tasks necessary to initialize and open a window:
<UL><B>auxInitWindow()</B> opens a window on the screen. It enables the
Escape key to be used to exit the program, and it sets the background color
for the window to black.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>auxInitPosition()</B> tells <B>auxInitWindow()</B> where to position
a window on the screen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>auxInitDisplayMode()</B> tells <B>auxInitWindow()</B> whether to
create an RGBA or color-index window. You can also specify a single- or
double-buffered window. (If you're working in color-index mode, you'll
want to load certain colors into the color map; use <B>auxSetOneColor()</B>
to do this.) Finally, you can use this routine to indicate that you want
the window to have an associated depth, stencil, and/or accumulation buffer.</UL>

<H4>
Handling Input Events</H4>
You can use these routines to register callback commands that are invoked
when specified events occur.
<UL><B>auxReshapeFunc()</B> indicates what action should be taken when
the window is resized, moved, or exposed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>auxKeyFunc()</B> and <B>auxMouseFunc()</B> allow you to link a keyboard
key or a mouse button with a routine that's invoked when the key or mouse
button is pressed or released.</UL>

<H4>
Drawing 3-D Objects</H4>
The auxiliary library includes several routines for drawing these three-dimensional
objects:
<P>sphere octahedron
<P>cube dodecahedron
<P>torus icosahedron
<P>cylinder teapot
<P>cone
<P>You can draw these objects as wireframes or as solid shaded objects
with surface normals defined. For example, the routines for a sphere and
a torus are as follows:
<P>void <B>auxWireSphere</B>(GLdouble <B>radius</B>);
<P>void <B>auxSolidSphere</B>(GLdouble <B>radius</B>);
<P>void <B>auxWireTorus</B>(GLdouble <B>innerRadius</B>, GLdouble <B>outerRadius</B>);
<P>void <B>auxSolidTorus</B>(GLdouble <B>innerRadius</B>, GLdouble <B>outerRadius</B>);
<P>All these models are drawn centered at the origin. When drawn with unit
scale factors, these models fit into a box with all coordinates from -1
to 1. Use the arguments for these routines to scale the objects.
<H4>
Managing a Background Process</H4>
You can specify a function that's to be executed if no other events are
pending - for example, when the event loop would otherwise be idle - with
<B>auxIdleFunc()</B>.
This routine takes a pointer to the function as its only argument. Pass
in zero to disable the execution of the function.
<H4>
Running the Program</H4>
Within your <B>main()</B> routine, call <B>auxMainLoop()</B> and pass it
the name of the routine that redraws the objects in your scene. Example
1-2 shows how you might use the auxiliary library to create the simple
program shown in Example 1-1 .

Animation</H2>
One of the most exciting things you can do on a graphics computer is draw
pictures that move. Whether you're an engineer trying to see all sides
of a mechanical part you're designing, a pilot learning to fly an airplane
using a simulation, or merely a computer-game aficionado, it's clear that
animation is an important part of computer graphics.
<P>In a movie theater, motion is achieved by taking a sequence of pictures
(24 per second), and then projecting them at 24 per second on the screen.
Each frame is moved into position behind the lens, the shutter is opened,
and the frame is displayed. The shutter is momentarily closed while the
film is advanced to the next frame, then that frame is displayed, and so
on. Although you're watching 24 different frames each second, your brain
blends them all into a smooth animation. (The old Charlie Chaplin movies
were shot at 16 frames per second and are noticeably jerky.) In fact, most
modern projectors display each picture twice at a rate of 48 per second
to reduce flickering. Computer-graphics screens typically refresh (redraw
the picture) approximately 60 to 76 times per second, and some even run
at about 120 refreshes per second. Clearly, 60 per second is smoother than
30, and 120 is marginally better than 60. Refresh rates faster than 120,
however, are beyond the point of diminishing returns, since the human eye
is only so good.
<P>The key idea that makes motion picture projection work is that when
it is displayed, each frame is complete. Suppose you try to do computer
animation of your million-frame movie with a program like this:
<PRE>open_window();&nbsp;
for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; clear_the_window();&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; draw_frame(i);&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; wait_until_a_24th_of_a_second_is_over();&nbsp;
}</PRE>
If you add the time it takes for your system to clear the screen and to
draw a typical frame, this program gives more and more disturbing results
depending on how close to 1/24 second it takes to clear and draw. Suppose
the drawing takes nearly a full 1/24 second. Items drawn first are visible
for the full 1/24 second and present a solid image on the screen; items
drawn toward the end are instantly cleared as the program starts on the
next frame, so they present at best a ghostlike image, since for most of
the 1/24 second your eye is viewing the cleared background instead of the
items that were unlucky enough to be drawn last. The problem is that this
program doesn't display completely drawn frames; instead, you watch the
drawing as it happens.
<P>An easy solution is to provide double-buffering - hardware or software
that supplies two complete color buffers. One is displayed while the other
is being drawn. When the drawing of a frame is complete, the two buffers
are swapped, so the one that was being viewed is now used for drawing,
and vice versa. It's like a movie projector with only two frames in a loop;
while one is being projected on the screen, an artist is desperately erasing
and redrawing the frame that's not visible. As long as the artist is quick
enough, the viewer notices no difference between this setup and one where
all the frames are already drawn and the projector is simply displaying
them one after the other. With double-buffering, every frame is shown only
when the drawing is complete; the viewer never sees a partially drawn frame.
<P>A modified version of the preceding program that does display smoothly
animated graphics might look like this:
<PRE>open_window_in_double_buffer_mode();&nbsp;
for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; clear_the_window();&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; draw_frame(i);&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; swap_the_buffers();&nbsp;
}</PRE>
In addition to simply swapping the viewable and drawable buffers, the <B>swap_the_buffers()</B>
routine waits until the current screen refresh period is over so that the
previous buffer is completely displayed. This routine also allows the new
buffer to be completely displayed, starting from the beginning. Assuming
that your system refreshes the display 60 times per second, this means
that the fastest frame rate you can achieve is 60 frames per second, and
if all your frames can be cleared and drawn in under 1/60 second, your
animation will run smoothly at that rate.
<P>What often happens on such a system is that the frame is too complicated
to draw in 1/60 second, so each frame is displayed more than once. If,
for example, it takes 1/45 second to draw a frame, you get 30 frames per
second, and the graphics are idle for 1/30-1/45=1/90 second per frame.
Although 1/90 second of wasted time might not sound bad, it's wasted each
1/30 second, so actually one-third of the time is wasted.
<P>In addition, the video refresh rate is constant, which can have some
unexpected performance consequences. For example, with the 1/60 second
per refresh monitor and a constant frame rate, you can run at 60 frames
per second, 30 frames per second, 20 per second, 15 per second, 12 per
second, and so on (60/1, 60/2, 60/3, 60/4, 60/5, ...). That means that
if you're writing an application and gradually adding features (say it's
a flight simulator, and you're adding ground scenery), at first each feature
you add has no effect on the overall performance - you still get 60 frames
per second. Then, all of a sudden, you add one new feature, and your performance
is cut in half because the system can't quite draw the whole thing in 1/60
of a second, so it misses the first possible buffer-swapping time. A similar
thing happens when the drawing time per frame is more than 1/30 second
- the performance drops from 30 to 20 frames per second, giving a 33 percent
performance hit.
<P>Another problem is that if the scene's complexity is close to any of
the magic times (1/60 second, 2/60 second, 3/60 second, and so on in this
example), then because of random variation, some frames go slightly over
the time and some slightly under, and the frame rate is irregular, which
can be visually disturbing. In this case, if you can't simplify the scene
so that all the frames are fast enough, it might be better to add an intentional
tiny delay to make sure they all miss, giving a constant, slower, frame
rate. If your frames have drastically different complexities, a more sophisticated
approach might be necessary.
<P>Interestingly, the structure of real animation programs does not differ
too much from this description. Usually, the entire buffer is redrawn from
scratch for each frame, as it is easier to do this than to figure out what
parts require redrawing. This is especially true with applications such
as three-dimensional flight simulators where a tiny change in the plane's
orientation changes the position of everything outside the window.
<P>In most animations, the objects in a scene are simply redrawn with different
transformations - the viewpoint of the viewer moves, or a car moves down
the road a bit, or an object is rotated slightly. If significant modifications
to a structure are being made for each frame where there's significant
recomputation, the attainable frame rate often slows down. Keep in mind,
however, that the idle time after the <B>swap_the_buffers()</B> routine
can often be used for such calculations.
<P>OpenGL doesn't have a <B>swap_the_buffers()</B> command because the
feature might not be available on all hardware and, in any case, it's highly
dependent on the window system. However, GLX provides such a command, for
use on machines that use the X Window System:
<PRE>void glXSwapBuffers(Display *<B>dpy</B>, Window <B>window</B>);</PRE>
Example 1-3 illustrates the use of <B>glXSwapBuffers()</B> in an example
that draws a square that rotates constantly, as shown in Figure 1-2 .
