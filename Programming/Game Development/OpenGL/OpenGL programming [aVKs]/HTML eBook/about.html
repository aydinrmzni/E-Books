About This Guide</H1>
The OpenGL graphics system is a software interface to graphics hardware.
(The GL stands for Graphics Library.) It allows you to create interactive
programs that produce color images of moving three-dimensional objects.
With OpenGL, you can control computer-graphics technology to produce realistic
pictures or ones that depart from reality in imaginative ways. This guide
explains how to program with the OpenGL graphics system to deliver the
visual effect you want.&nbsp;
<HR>
<H2>
What This Guide Contains</H2>
This guide has the ideal number of chapters: 13. The first six chapters
present basic information that you need to understand to be able to draw
a properly colored and lit three-dimensional object on the screen:
<UL>Chapter 1, "Introduction to OpenGL," provides a glimpse into the kinds
of things OpenGL can do. It also presents a simple OpenGL program and explains
essential programming details you need to know for subsequent chapters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 2, "Drawing Geometric Objects," explains how to create a three-dimensional
geometric description of an object that is eventually drawn on the screen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 3, "Viewing," describes how such three-dimensional models are
transformed before being drawn onto a two-dimensional screen. You can control
these transformations to show a particular view of a model.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 4, "Display Lists," discusses how to store a series of OpenGL
commands for execution at a later time. You'll want to use this feature
to increase the performance of your OpenGL program.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 5, "Color," describes how to specify the color and shading method
used to draw an object.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 6, "Lighting," explains how to control the lighting conditions
surrounding an object and how that object responds to light (that is, how
it reflects or absorbs light). Lighting is an important topic, since objects
usually don't look three-dimensional until they're lit.</UL>
The remaining chapters explain how to add sophisticated features to your
three-dimensional scene. You might choose not to take advantage of many
of these features until you're more comfortable with OpenGL. Particularly
advanced topics are noted in the text where they occur.
<UL>Chapter 7, "Blending, Antialiasing, and Fog," describes techniques
essential to creating a realistic scene - alpha blending (which allows
you to create transparent objects), antialiasing, and atmospheric effects
(such as fog or smog).
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 8, "Drawing Pixels, Bitmaps, Fonts, and Images," discusses how
to work with sets of two-dimensional data as bitmaps or images. One typical
use for bitmaps is to describe characters in fonts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 9, "Texture Mapping," explains how to map one- and two-dimensional
images called textures onto three-dimensional objects. Many marvelous effects
can be achieved through texture mapping.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 10, "The Framebuffer," describes all the possible buffers that
can exist in an OpenGL implementation and how you can control them. You
can use the buffers for such effects as hidden-surface elimination, stenciling,
masking, motion blur, and depth-of-field focusing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 11, "Evaluators and NURBS," gives an introduction to advanced
techniques for efficiently generating curves or surfaces.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 12, "Selection and Feedback," explains how you can use OpenGL's
selection mechanism to select an object on the screen. It also explains
the feedback mechanism, which allows you to collect the drawing information
OpenGL produces rather than having it be used to draw on the screen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Chapter 13, "Now That You Know," describes how to use OpenGL in several
clever and unexpected ways to produce interesting results. These techniques
are drawn from years of experience with the technological precursor to
OpenGL, the Silicon Graphics IRIS Graphics Library.</UL>
In addition, there are several appendices that you will likely find useful:
<UL>Appendix A, "Order of Operations," gives a technical overview of the
operations OpenGL performs, briefly describing them in the order in which
they occur as an application executes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix B, "OpenGL State Variables," lists the state variables that
OpenGL maintains and describes how to obtain their values.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix C, "The OpenGL Utility Library," briefly describes the routines
available in the OpenGL Utility Library.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix D, "The OpenGL Extension to the X Window System," briefly describes
the routines available in the OpenGL extension to the X Window System.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix E, "The OpenGL Programming Guide Auxiliary Library," discusses
a small C code library that was written for this book to make code examples
shorter and more comprehensible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix F, "Calculating Normal Vectors," tells you how to calculate
normal vectors for different types of geometric objects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix G, "Homogeneous Coordinates and Transformation Matrices," explains
some of the mathematics behind matrix transformations.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix H, "Programming Tips," lists some programming tips based on
the intentions of the designers of OpenGL that you might find useful.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix I, "OpenGL Invariance," describes the pixel-exact invariance
rules that OpenGL implementations follow.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Appendix J, "Color Plates," contains the color plates that appear in
the printed version of this guide.</UL>
Finally, an extensive Glossary defines the key terms used in this guide.
<HR>
<H2>
How to Obtain the Sample Code</H2>
This guide contains many sample programs to illustrate the use of particular
OpenGL programming techniques. These programs make use of a small auxiliary
library that was written for this guide. The section "OpenGL-related Libraries"
gives more information about this auxiliary library. You can obtain the
source code for both the sample programs and the auxiliary library for
free via ftp (file-transfer protocol) if you have access to the Internet.
<P>First, use ftp to go to the host sgigate.sgi.com, and use <B>anonymous</B>
as your user name and <I>your_name</I>@<I>machine</I> as the password.
Then type the following:
<PRE>cd pub/opengl
binary
get opengl.tar.Z
bye</PRE>
The file you receive is a compressed <I>tar</I> archive. To restore the
files, type:
<PRE>uncompress opengl.tar
tar xf opengl.tar</PRE>
The sample programs and auxiliary library are created as subdirectories
from wherever you are in the file directory structure.
<P>Many implementations of OpenGL might also include the code samples and
auxiliary library as part of the system. This source code is probably the
best source for your implementation, because it might have been optimized
for your system. Read your machine-specific OpenGL documentation to see
where the code samples can be found.&nbsp;
<HR>
<H2>
What You Should Know Before Reading This Guide</H2>
This guide assumes only that you know how to program in the C language
and that you have some background in mathematics (geometry, trigonometry,
linear algebra, calculus, and differential geometry). Even if you have
little or no experience with computer-graphics technology, you should be
able to follow most of the discussions in this book. Of course, computer
graphics is a huge subject, so you may want to enrich your learning experience
with supplemental reading:
<UL><I>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice</I> by James D. Foley,
Andries van Dam, Steven K. Feiner, and John F. Hughes (Reading, Mass.:
Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.) - This book is an encyclopedic treatment
of the subject of computer graphics. It includes a wealth of information
but is probably best read after you have some experience with the subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><I>3D Computer Graphics: A User's Guide for Artists and Designers</I>
by Andrew S. Glassner (New York: Design Press) - This book is a nontechnical,
gentle introduction to computer graphics. It focuses on the visual effects
that can be achieved rather than on the techniques needed to achieve them.</UL>
Once you begin programming with OpenGL, you might want to obtain the <I>OpenGL
Reference Manual</I> by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (Reading,
Mass.: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1993), which is designed as a companion
volume to this guide. The <I>Reference Manual</I> provides a technical
view of how OpenGL operates on data that describes a geometric object or
an image to produce an image on the screen. It also contains full descriptions
of each set of related OpenGL commands - the parameters used by the commands,
the default values for those parameters, and what the commands accomplish.
<P>"OpenGL" is really a hardware-independent specification of a programming
interface. You use a particular implementation of it on a particular kind
of hardware. This guide explains how to program with <I>any</I> OpenGL
implementation. However, since implementations may vary slightly - in performance
and in providing additional, optional features, for example - you might
want to investigate whether supplementary documentation is available for
the particular implementation you're using. In addition, you might have
OpenGL-related utilities, toolkits, programming and debugging support,
widgets, sample programs, and demos available to you with your system.&nbsp;
<HR>
<H2>
Style Conventions</H2>
These style conventions are used in this guide:
<UL><B>Bold</B> - Command and routine names, and matrices
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><I>Italics</I> - Variables, arguments, parameter names, spatial dimensions,
and matrix components
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Regular - Enumerated types and defined constants</UL>
Code examples are set off from the text in a monospace font, and command
summaries are shaded with gray boxes.
<P>Topics that are particularly complicated - and that you can skip if
you're new to OpenGL or computer graphics - are marked with the Advanced
icon. This icon can apply to a single paragraph or to an entire section
or chapter.
<P><B>Advanced</B>
<P>Exercises that are left for the reader are marked with the Try This
icon.

Acknowledgments</H2>
No book comes into being without the help of many people. Probably the
largest debt the authors owe is to the creators of OpenGL itself. The OpenGL
team at Silicon Graphics has been led by Kurt Akeley, Bill Glazier, Kipp
Hickman, Phil Karlton, Mark Segal, Kevin P. Smith, and Wei Yen. The members
of the OpenGL Architecture Review Board naturally need to be counted among
the designers of OpenGL: Dick Coulter and John Dennis of Digital Equipment
Corporation; Jim Bushnell and Linas Vepstas of International Business Machines,
Corp.; Murali Sundaresan and Rick Hodgson of Intel; and On Lee and Chuck
Whitmore of Microsoft. Other early contributors to the design of OpenGL
include Raymond Drewry of Gain Technology, Inc., Fred Fisher of Digital
Equipment Corporation, and Randi Rost of Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.
Many other Silicon Graphics employees helped refine the definition and
functionality of OpenGL, including Momi Akeley, Allen Akin, Chris Frazier,
Paul Ho, Simon Hui, Lesley Kalmin, Pierre Tardiff, and Jim Winget.
<P>Many brave souls volunteered to review this book: Kurt Akeley, Gavin
Bell, Sam Chen, Andrew Cherenson, Dan Fink, Beth Fryer, Gretchen Helms,
David Marsland, Jeanne Rich, Mark Segal, Kevin P. Smith, and Josie Wernecke
from Silicon Graphics; David Niguidula, Coalition of Essential Schools,
Brown University; John Dennis and Andy Vesper, Digital Equipment Corporation;
Chandrasekhar Narayanaswami and Linas Vepstas, International Business Machines,
Corp.; Randi Rost, Kubota Pacific; On Lee, Microsoft Corp.; Dan Sears;
Henry McGilton, Trilithon Software; and Paula Womak.
<P>Assembling the set of colorplates was no mean feat. The sequence of
plates based on the cover image (Figure J-1 through Figure J-9 ) was created
by Thad Beier of Pacific Data Images, Seth Katz of Xaos Tools, Inc., and
Mason Woo of Silicon Graphics. Figure J-10 through Figure J-32 are snapshots
of programs created by Mason. Gavin Bell, Kevin Goldsmith, Linda Roy, and
Mark Daly (all of Silicon Graphics) created the fly-through program used
for Figure J-34 . The model for Figure J-35 was created by Barry Brouillette
of Silicon Graphics; Doug Voorhies, also of Silicon Graphics, performed
some image processing for the final image. Figure J-36 was created by John
Rohlf and Michael Jones, both of Silicon Graphics. Figure J-37 was created
by Carl Korobkin of Silicon Graphics. Figure J-38 is a snapshot from a
program written by Gavin Bell with contributions from the Inventor team
at Silicon Graphics - Alain Dumesny, Dave Immel, David Mott, Howard Look,
Paul Isaacs, Paul Strauss, and Rikk Carey. Figure J-39 and Figure J-40
are snapshots from a visual simulation program created by the Silicon Graphics
IRIS Performer team - Craig Phillips, John Rohlf, Sharon Fischler, Jim
Helman, and Michael Jones - from a database produced for Silicon Graphics
by Paradigm Simulation, Inc. Figure J-41 is a snapshot from skyfly, the
precursor to Performer, which was created by John Rohlf, Sharon Fischler,
and Ben Garlick, all of Silicon Graphics.
<P>Several other people played special roles in creating this book. If
we were to list other names as authors on the front of this book, Kurt
Akeley and Mark Segal would be there, as honorary yeoman. They helped define
the structure and goals of the book, provided key sections of material
for it, reviewed it when everybody else was too tired of it to do so, and
supplied that all-important humor and support throughout the process. Kay
Maitz provided invaluable production and design assistance. Kathy Gochenour
very generously created many of the illustrations for this book. Tanya
Kucak copyedited the manuscript, in her usual thorough and professional
style.
<P>And now, each of the authors would like to take the 15 minutes that
have been allotted to them by Andy Warhol to say thank you.
<P>I'd like to thank my managers at Silicon Graphics - Dave Larson and
Way Ting - and the members of my group - Patricia Creek, Arthur Evans,
Beth Fryer, Jed Hartman, Ken Jones, Robert Reimann, Eve Stratton (aka Margaret-Anne
Halse), John Stearns, and Josie Wernecke - for their support during this
lengthy process. Last but surely not least, I want to thank those whose
contributions toward this project are too deep and mysterious to elucidate:
Yvonne Leach, Kathleen Lancaster, Caroline Rose, Cindy Kleinfeld, and my
parents, Florence and Ferdinand Neider.
<P>&nbsp;- JLN
<P>In addition to my parents, Edward and Irene Davis, I'd like to thank
the people who taught me most of what I know about computers and computer
graphics - Doug Engelbart and Jim Clark.
<P>&nbsp;- TRD
<P>I'd like to thank the many past and current members of Silicon Graphics
whose accommodation and enlightenment were essential to my contribution
to this book: Gerald Anderson, Wendy Chin, Bert Fornaciari, Bill Glazier,
Jill Huchital, Howard Look, Bill Mannel, David Marsland, Dave Orton, Linda
Roy, Keith Seto, and Dave Shreiner. Very special thanks to Karrin Nicol
and Leilani Gayles of SGI for their guidance throughout my career. I also
bestow much gratitude to my teammates on the Stanford B ice hockey team
for periods of glorious distraction throughout the writing of this book.
Finally, I'd like to thank my family, especially my mother, Bo, and my
late father, Henry.

However, it is presented in a format unsuitable for download and off-line
browsing, since it is accessed and cross-referenced using cgi scripts.
I manually downloaded and edited all the text and figures, removed most
of the links in the text and reformatted the chapters into single files.
None of this was made for profit or for the purpose of violating copyright
- the book was online, and I just made it easier to use and download. All
