Color</H1>
<B>Chapter Objectives</B>
<P>After reading this chapter, you'll be able to do the following:
<UL>Decide between using RGBA or color-index mode for your application
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Specify desired colors for drawing objects
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Use smooth shading to draw a single polygon with more than one color</UL>
The goal of almost all OpenGL applications is to draw color pictures in
a window on the screen. The window is a rectangular array of pixels, each
of which contains and displays its own color. Thus, in a sense, the point
of all the calculations performed by an OpenGL implementation - calculations
that take into account OpenGL commands, state information, and values of
parameters - is to determine the final color of every pixel that's to be
drawn in the window. This chapter explains the commands for specifying
colors and how OpenGL interprets them in the following major sections:
<UL>"Color Perception" discusses how the eye perceives color.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>"Computer Color" describes the relationship between pixels on a computer
monitor and their colors; it also defines the two display modes, RGBA and
color index.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>"RGBA versus Color-Index Mode" explains how the two display modes use
graphics hardware and how to decide which mode to use.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>"Specifying a Color and a Shading Model" describes the OpenGL commands
you use to specify the desired color or shading model.</UL>

<H2>
Color Perception</H2>
Physically, light is composed of photons - tiny particles of light, each
traveling along its own path, and each vibrating at its own frequency (or
wavelength, or energy - any one of frequency, wavelength, or energy determines
the others). A photon is completely characterized by its position, direction,
and frequency/wavelength/energy. Photons with wavelengths ranging from
about 390 nanometers (nm) (violet) and 720 nm (red) cover the colors of
the visible spectrum, forming the colors of a rainbow (violet, indigo,
blue, green, yellow, orange, red). However, your eyes perceive lots of
colors that aren't in the rainbow - white, black, brown, and pink, for
example. How does this happen?
<P>What your eye actually sees is a mixture of photons of different frequencies.
Real light sources are characterized by the distribution of photon frequencies
they emit. Ideal white light consists of an equal amount of light of all
frequencies. Laser light is usually very pure, and all photons have almost
identical frequencies (and direction and phase, as well). Light from a
sodium-vapor lamp has more light in the yellow frequency. Light from most
stars in space has a distribution that depends heavily on their temperatures
(black-body radiation). The frequency distribution of light from most sources
in your immediate environment is more complicated.
<P>The human eye perceives color when certain cells in the retina (called
<I>cone cells</I>, or just <I>cones</I>) become excited after being struck
by photons. The three different kinds of cone cells respond best to three
different wavelengths of light: one type of cone cell responds best to
red light, one type to green, and the other to blue. (A person who is color-blind
is usually missing one or more types of cone cells.) When a given mixture
of photons enters the eye, the cone cells in the retina register different
degrees of excitation depending on their types, and if a different mixture
of photons comes in that happens to excite the three types of cone cells
to the same degrees, its color is indistinguishable from that of the first
mixture.
<P>Since each color is recorded by the eye as the levels of excitation
of the cone cells by the incoming photons, the eye can perceive colors
that aren't in the spectrum produced by a prism or rainbow. For example,
if you send a mixture of red and blue photons so that both the red and
blue cones in the retina are excited, your eye sees it as magenta, which
isn't in the spectrum. Other combinations give browns, turquoises, and
mauves, none of which appear in the color spectrum.
<P>A computer-graphics monitor emulates visible colors by lighting pixels
with a combination of red, green, and blue light in proportions that excite
the red-, green-, and blue-sensitive cones in the retina in such a way
that it matches the excitation levels generated by the photon mix it's
trying to emulate. If humans had more types of cone cells, some that were
yellow-sensitive for example, color monitors would probably have a yellow
gun as well, and we'd use RGBY (red, green, blue, yellow) quadruples to
specify colors. And if everyone were color-blind in the same way, this
chapter would be simpler.
<P>To display a particular color, the monitor sends the right amounts of
red, green, and blue light to appropriately stimulate the different types
of cone cells in your eye. A color monitor can send different proportions
of red, green, and blue to each of the pixels, and the eye sees a million
or so pinpoints of light, each with its own color.
<P>This section considers only how the eye perceives combinations of photons
that enter it. The situation for light bouncing off of materials and entering
the eye is even more complex - white light bouncing off a red ball will
appear red, or yellow light shining through blue glass appears almost black,
for example. These effects are discussed in "Real-World and OpenGL Lighting."
<BR>&nbsp;

<H2>
Computer Color</H2>
On a color computer screen, the hardware causes each pixel on the screen
to emit different amounts of red, green, and blue light. These are called
the R, G, and B values. They're often packed together (sometimes with a
fourth value, called alpha, or A), and the packed value is called the RGB
(or RGBA) value. (See "Blending" for an explanation of the alpha values.)
The color information at each pixel can be stored either in RGBA mode,
in which the R, G, B, and possibly A values are kept for each pixel, or
in color-index mode, in which a single number (called the color index)
is stored for each pixel. Each color index indicates an entry in a table
that defines a particular set of R, G, and B values. Such a table is called
a color map.
<P>In color-index mode, you might want to alter the values in the color
map. Since color maps are controlled by the window system, there are no
OpenGL commands to do this. All the examples in this book initialize the
color-display mode at the time the window is opened by using routines from
the auxiliary library, which is described in detail in Appendix E .
<P>Different graphics hardware varies greatly in both the size of the pixel
array and the number of colors that can be displayed at each pixel. On
a given graphics system, every pixel has the same amount of memory for
storing its color, and all the memory for all the pixels is called the
<I>color buffer</I>. The size of a buffer is usually measured in bits,
so an 8-bit buffer could store 8 bits of data (256 possible different colors)
for each pixel. The size of the possible buffers varies from machine to
machine. (See Chapter 10 for more information.)
<P>The R, G, and B values can range from 0.0 (none) to 1.0 (full intensity).
For example, R = 0.0, G = 0.0, and B = 1.0 represents the brightest possible
blue. If R, G, and B are all 0.0, the pixel is black; if all are 1.0, the
pixel is drawn in the brightest white that can be displayed on the screen.
Blending green and blue creates shades of cyan. Blue and red combine for
magenta. Red and green create yellow. To help you create the colors you
want from the R, G, and B components, look at the color cube shown in Figure
J-12 . The axes of this cube represent intensities of red, blue, and green.
A black-and-white version of the cube is shown in Figure 5-1 .
<P><IMG SRC="figures/fig5-1.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" >
<P><B>Figure 5-1 : </B>The Color Cube in Black and White
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>The commands to specify a color for an object (in this case, a point)
can be as simple as this:
<PRE>glColor3f (1.0, 0.0, 0.0);&nbsp; /* the current RGB color is red: */
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* full red, no green, no blue. */
glBegin (GL_POINTS);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glVertex3fv (point_array);
glEnd ();</PRE>
In certain modes (for example, if lighting or texturing calculations are
performed), the assigned color might go through other operations before
arriving in the framebuffer as a value representing a color for a pixel.
In fact, the color of a pixel is determined by a lengthy sequence of operations.
<P>Early in a program's execution, the color-display mode is set to either
RGBA mode or color-index mode. Once the color-display mode is initialized,
it can't be changed. As the program executes, a color (either a color index
or an RGBA value) is determined on a per-vertex basis for each geometric
primitive. Either a color you've explicitly specified for a vertex is used
or, if lighting is enabled, the transformation matrices interact with the
surface normals and other material properties to determine the vertex's
color. In other words, a red ball with a blue light shining on it looks
different from the same ball with no light on it. (See Chapter 6 for details.)
After the relevant lighting calculations are performed, the chosen shading
model is applied. As explained in "Specifying a Color and a Shading Model,"
you can choose flat or smooth shading, each of which has different effects
on the eventual color of a pixel.
<P>Next, the primitives are rasterized, or converted to a two-dimensional
image. Rasterizing involves determining which squares of an integer grid
in window coordinates are occupied by the primitive and then assigning
color and other values to each such square. A grid square along with its
associated values of color, <I>z</I> (depth), and texture coordinates is
called a fragment. Pixels are elements of the framebuffer; a fragment comes
from a primitive and is combined with its corresponding pixel to yield
a new pixel. Once a fragment is constructed, texturing, fog, and antialiasing
are applied - if they're enabled - to the fragments. After that, any specified
alpha blending, dithering, and bitwise logical operations are carried out
using the fragment and the pixel already stored in the framebuffer. Finally,
the fragment's color value (either color index or RGBA) is written into
the pixel and displayed in the window using the window's color-display
mode.
<BR>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<HR></PRE>

<H2>
RGBA versus Color-Index Mode</H2>
In either color-index or RGBA mode, a certain amount of color data is stored
at each pixel. This amount is determined by the number of bitplanes in
the framebuffer. A bitplane contains one bit of data for each pixel. If
there are eight color bitplanes, there are 8 color bits per pixel, and
hence 28 = 256 different values or colors that can be stored at the pixel.
<P>Bitplanes are often divided evenly into storage for R, G, and B components
(that is, a 24-bitplane system devotes 8 bits each to red, green, and blue),
but this isn't always true. To find out the number of bitplanes available
on your system for red, green, blue, alpha, or color-index values, use
<B>glGetIntegerv()</B> with GL_RED_BITS, GL_GREEN_BITS, GL_BLUE_BITS, GL_ALPHA_BITS,
and GL_INDEX_BITS.
<P>Color intensities on most computer screens aren't perceived as linear
by the human eye. Consider colors consisting of just a red component, with
green and blue set to zero. As the intensity varies from 0.0 (off) to 1.0
(full on), the number of electrons striking the pixels increases, but the
question is, does 0.5 look like halfway between 0.0 and 1.0? To test this,
write a program that draws alternate pixels in a checkerboard pattern to
intensities 0.0 and 1.0, and compare it with a region drawn solidly in
color 0.5. OpenGL assumes they're the same. If they're not, you need to
use whatever correction mechanism is provided on your particular system.
For example, many systems have a table to adjust intensities so that 0.5
appears to be halfway between 0.0 and 1.0. The mapping usually used is
an exponential one, with the exponent referred to as gamma (hence the term
gamma correction). Using the same gamma for the red, green, and blue components
gives pretty good results, but three different gamma values might give
slightly better results. For more details on this topic, see Foley, van
Dam, et al.
<H3>
RGBA Display Mode</H3>
In RGBA mode, the hardware sets aside a certain number of bitplanes for
each of the R, G, B, and A components (not necessarily the same number
for each component). See Figure 5-2 . The R, G, and B values are typically
stored as integers rather than floating-point numbers, and they're scaled
to the number of available bits for storage and retrieval. For example,
if a system has 8 bits available for the R component, integers between
0 and 255 can be stored; thus, 0, 1, 2, ..., 255 in the bitplanes would
correspond to R values of 0/255 = 0.0, 1/255, 2/255, ..., 255/255 = 1.0.
Regardless of the number of bitplanes, 0.0 specifies the minimum intensity,
and 1.0 specifies the maximum intensity.
<P><IMG SRC="figures/fig5-2.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" >
<P><B>Figure 5-2 : </B>RGB Values from the Bitplanes
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>The alpha value (the A in RGBA) has no direct effect on the color displayed
on the screen. It can be used for many things, including blending and transparency,
and it can have an effect on the values of R, G, and B that are written.
See "Blending" for more information about alpha values.
<P>The number of distinct colors that can be displayed at a single pixel
depends on the number of bitplanes and the capacity of the hardware to
interpret those bitplanes. The number of distinct colors can't exceed 2n,
where <I>n</I> is the number of bitplanes. Thus, a machine with 24 bitplanes
for RGB can display up to 16.77 million distinct colors.
<H4>
Dithering</H4>
<B>Advanced</B>
<P>Some graphics hardware uses dithering to increase the number of displayable
colors at the expense of spatial resolution. Dithering is the technique
of using combinations of some colors to create the effect of other colors.
To illustrate how dithering works, suppose your system has only one bit
each for R, G, and B, so it can display only eight colors: black, white,
red, blue, green, yellow, cyan, and magenta. To display a pink region,
the hardware can fill the region in a checkerboard manner, alternating
red and white pixels. If your eye is far enough back from the screen that
it can't distinguish individual pixels, the region appears pink - the average
of red and white. Redder pinks can be achieved by filling a higher proportion
of the pixels with red, whiter pinks would use more white pixels, and so
on.
<P>With this technique, there are no pink pixels. The only way to achieve
the effect of "pinkness" is to cover a region consisting of multiple pixels
- you can't dither a single pixel. If you specify an RGB value for an unavailable
color and fill a polygon, the hardware fills the pixels in the interior
of the polygon with a mixture of nearby colors whose average appears to
your eye to be the color you want. (Remember, though, that if you're reading
pixel information out of the framebuffer, you get the actual red and white
pixel values, since there aren't any pink ones. See Chapter 8 for more
information about reading pixel values.)
<P>Figure 5-3 illustrates some simple dithering of black and white pixels
to make shades of gray. From left to right, the 4 × 4 patterns at the top
represent dithering patterns for 50 percent, 19 percent, and 69 percent
gray. Under each pattern, you can see repeated reduced copies of each pattern,
but these black and white squares are still bigger than most pixels. If
you look at them from across the room, you can see that they blur together
and appear as three levels of gray.
<P><IMG SRC="figures/dither.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" >
<P><B>Figure 5-3 : </B>Dithering Black and White to Create Gray
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>With about 8 bits each of R, G, and B, you can get a fairly high-quality
image without dithering. Just because your machine has twenty-four color
bitplanes, however, doesn't mean that dithering won't occur. For example,
if you are running in double-buffer mode, the bitplanes might be divided
into two sets of twelve, so there are really only 4 bits each per R, G,
and B component. Without dithering, 4-bit-per-component color can give
less than satisfactory results in many situations.
<P>You enable or disable dithering by passing GL_DITHER to <B>glEnable()</B>
or <B>glDisable()</B>.
<H3>
Color-Index Display Mode</H3>
With color-index mode, OpenGL uses a color map (or <I>lookup table</I>),
which is similar to using a palette to mix paints to prepare for a paint-by-number
scene. A painter's palette provides spaces to mix paints together; similarly,
a computer's color map provides indices where the primary red, green, and
blue values can be mixed, as shown in Figure 5-4 .
<P><IMG SRC="figures/fig5-4.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" >
<P><B>Figure 5-4 : </B>A Color Map
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>A painter filling in a paint-by-number scene chooses a color from the
color palette and fills the corresponding numbered regions with that color.
A computer stores the color index in the bitplanes for each pixel. Then
those bitplane values reference the color map, and the screen is painted
with the corresponding red, green, and blue values from the color map,
as shown in Figure 5-5 .
<P><IMG SRC="figures/ch05-5.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" >
<P><B>Figure 5-5 : </B>Using a Color Map to Paint a Picture
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>In color-index mode, the number of simultaneously available colors is
limited by the size of the color map and the number of bitplanes available.
The size of the color map is determined by the amount of hardware dedicated
to it. Typical sizes range from 256 (28) to 4096 (212). The size of the
color map is a power of 2, indexed by the number of bitplanes available
in color-index mode. If there are 2n indices in the color map and <I>m</I>
available bitplanes, the number of usable entries is the smaller of 2n
and 2m.
<P>With RGBA mode, each pixel's color is independent of other pixels. However,
in color-index mode, each pixel with the same index stored in its bitplanes
shares the same color-map location. If the contents of an entry in the
color map change, then all pixels of that color index change their color.
<H3>
Choosing between RGBA and Color-Index Mode</H3>
You should base your decision to use RGBA or color-index mode on what hardware
is available and on what your application needs. For most systems, more
colors can be simultaneously represented with RGBA mode than with color-index
mode. Also, for several effects, such as shading, lighting, texture mapping,
and fog, RGBA provides more flexibility than color-index mode.
<P>You might prefer to use color-index mode in the following cases:
<UL>If you're porting an existing application that makes significant use
of color-index mode, it might be easiest to not change to RGBA mode.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>If you have only a small number <I>n</I> of bitplanes available and
if you need fewer than 2n different colors, you should consider color-index
mode.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>If you have a limited number of bitplanes available, RGBA mode might
produce noticeably coarse shading. Color-index mode might work better if
you have limited shading requirements (only shades of gray, for example).
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Color-index mode can be useful for various tricks, such as color-map
animation and drawing in layers. See Chapter 13 for more information.</UL>
In general, use RGBA mode: It works with texture mapping and works better
with lighting, shading, fog, antialiasing, and blending.
<BR>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<HR></PRE>

<H2>
Specifying a Color and a Shading Model</H2>
OpenGL maintains a current color (in RGBA mode) and a current color index
(in color-index mode). Unless you're using a more complicated coloring
model such as lighting or texture mapping, each object is drawn using the
current color (or color index). Look at the following pseudocode sequence:
<PRE>set_color(RED);
draw_item(A);
draw_item(B);
set_color(GREEN);
set_color(BLUE);
draw_item(C);</PRE>
Items A and B are drawn in red, and item C is drawn in blue. The fourth
line, which sets the current color to green, has no effect (except to waste
a bit of time). With no lighting or texturing, when the current color is
set, all items drawn afterward are drawn in that color until the current
color is changed to something else.
<H3>
Specifying a Color in RGBA Mode</H3>
In RGBA mode, use the <B>glColor*()</B> command to select a current color.void
<B>glColor3</B>{b s i f d ub us ui} (<B>TYPE</B><I>r</I>, <B>TYPE</B><I>g</I>,
<B>TYPE</B><I>b</I>);
<BR>void <B>glColor4</B>{b s i f d ub us ui} (<B>TYPE</B><I>r</I>, <B>TYPE</B><I>g</I>,
<B>TYPE</B><I>b</I>, <B>TYPE</B><I>a</I>);
<BR>void <B>glColor3</B>{b s i f d ub us ui}<B>v</B> (const <B>TYPE</B><I>*v</I>);
<BR>void <B>glColor4</B>{b s i f d ub us ui}<B>v</B> (const <B>TYPE</B><I>*v</I>);
<P>Sets the current red, green, blue, and alpha values. This command can
have up to three suffixes, which differentiate variations of the parameters
accepted. The first suffix is either 3 or 4, to indicate whether you supply
an alpha value in addition to the red, green, and blue values. If you don't
supply an alpha value, it's automatically set to 1.0. The second suffix
indicates the data type for parameters: byte, short, integer, float, double,
unsigned byte, unsigned short, or unsigned integer. The third suffix is
an optional <B>v</B>, which indicates that the argument is a pointer to
an array of values of the given data type.
<P>For the versions of <B>glColor*()</B> that accept floating-point data
types, the values should typically range between 0.0 and 1.0, the minimum
and maximum values that can be stored in the framebuffer. (Values ouside
the range [0,1] are clamped to the range [0,1] when used directly, but
aren't clamped when used to modify lighting material parameters.) Unsigned-integer
color components, when specified, are linearly mapped to floating-point
values such that the largest representable value maps to 1.0 (full intensity),
and zero maps to 0.0 (zero intensity). Signed-integer color components,
when specified, are linearly mapped to floating-point values such that
the most positive representable value maps to 1.0, and the most negative
representable value maps to -1.0 (see Table 5-1 ). Floating-point values
are mapped directly. Neither floating-point nor signed-integer values are
clamped to the range [0,1] before updating the current color. However,
color components are clamped to this range before they are interpolated
or written into a color buffer.

Specifying a Color in Color-Index Mode</H3>
In color-index mode, use the <B>glIndex*()</B> command to select a single-valued
color index as the current color index. void <B>glIndex</B>{sifd}(TYPE
<I>c</I>);
<BR>void <B>glIndex</B>{sifd}<B>v</B>(const TYPE <I>*c</I>);
<P>Sets the current color index. The first suffix for this command indicates
the data type for parameters: short, integer, float, or double. The second,
optional suffix is <B>v</B>, which indicates that the argument is an array
of values of the given data type (the array contains only one value).
<P><B>Advanced</B>
<P>The current index is stored as a floating-point value. Integer values
are converted directly to floating-point values, with no special mapping.
Index values outside the representable range of the color-index buffer
aren't clamped. However, before an index is dithered (if enabled) and written
to the framebuffer, it's converted to fixed-point format. Any bits in the
integer portion of the resulting fixed-point value that don't correspond
to bits in the framebuffer are masked out.
<H3>
Specifying a Shading Model</H3>
A line or a filled polygon primitive can be drawn with a single color (flat
shading) or with many different colors (smooth shading, also called Gouraud
shading). You specify the desired shading technique with <B>glShadeModel()</B>.void
<B>glShadeModel</B> (GLenum <I>mode</I>);
<P>Sets the shading model. The mode parameter can be either GL_SMOOTH (the
default) or GL_FLAT.
<P>With flat shading, the color of one vertex of a primitive is duplicated
across all the primitive's vertices. With smooth shading, the color at
each vertex is treated individually. For a line primitive, the colors along
the line segment are interpolated between the vertex colors. For a polygon
primitive, the colors for the interior of the polygon are interpolated
between the vertex colors. Example 5-1 draws a smooth-shaded triangle,
as shown in Figure J-11 .

With smooth shading, neighboring pixels have slightly different color values.
In RGBA mode, adjacent pixels with slightly different values look similar,
so the color changes across a polygon appear gradual. In color-index mode,
adjacent pixels may reference different locations in the color-index table,
which may not have similar colors at all. Adjacent color-index entries
may contain wildly different colors, so a smooth-shaded polygon in color-index
mode can look psychedelic.
<P>To avoid this problem, you have to create a color ramp of smoothly changing
colors among a contiguous set of indices in the color map. Remember that
loading colors into a color map is performed through your window system
rather than OpenGL. For the moment, however, assume you have an <B>auxSetOneColor()</B>
routine that loads a single index in the color map with specified red,
green, and blue values. The first argument for this routine is the index,
and the others are the red, green, and blue values. To load thirty-two
contiguous color indices (from color index 16 to 47) with slightly differing
shades of yellow, you might call
<PRE>for(i=0; i&lt;32; i++){
&nbsp;&nbsp; auxSetOneColor(16+i, 1.0*(i/32.0), 1.0*(i/32.0), 0.0);
}</PRE>
Now, if you render smooth-shaded polygons that use only the colors from
index 16 to 47, those polygons have gradually differing shades of yellow.
<P>With flat shading, the color of a single vertex defines the color of
an entire primitive. For a line segment, the color of the line is the current
color when the second (ending) vertex is specified. For a polygon, the
color used is the one that's in effect when a particular vertex is specified,
as shown in Table 5-2 . The table counts vertices and polygons starting
from 1. OpenGL follows these rules consistently, but the best way to avoid
uncertainty about how a flat-shaded primitive will be drawn is to specify
only one color for the primitive.
