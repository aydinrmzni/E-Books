Appendix G<BR>
Homogeneous Coordinates and Transformation Matrices</H1>
This appendix presents a brief discussion of homogeneous coordinates. It
also lists the form of the transformation matrices used for rotation, scaling,
translation, perspective projection, and orthographic projection. These
topics are introduced and discussed in Chapter 3 . For a more detailed
discussion of these subjects, see almost any book on three-dimensional
computer graphics - for example, <I>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice,</I>
by Foley, Van Dam, Feiner, and Hughes (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley)
- or a text on projective geometry - for example, <I>The Real Projective
Plane</I>, by H. S. M. Coxeter, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1961). In the discussion that follows, the term homogeneous coordinates
always means three-dimensional homogeneous coordinates, although projective
geometries exist for all dimensions.

<A NAME="X"></A>Homogeneous Coordinates</H2>
OpenGL commands usually deal with two- and three-dimensional vertices,
but in fact all are treated internally as three-dimensional homogeneous
vertices comprising four coordinates. Every column vector (<I>x, y, z,
w</I>)T represents a homogeneous vertex if at least one of its elements
is nonzero. If the real number <B>a</B> is nonzero, then (<I>x, y, z, w</I>)T
and (<B>a</B>x,<B> a</B>y,<B> a</B>z,<B> a</B>w)T represent the same homogeneous
vertex. (This is just like fractions: <I>x</I>/<I>y</I> = (<B>a</B>x)/(<B>a</B>y).)
A three-dimensional euclidean space point (<I>x, y, z</I>)T becomes the
homogeneous vertex with coordinates (<I>x, y, z</I>, 1.0)T, and the two-dimensional
euclidean point (<I>x, y</I>)T becomes (<I>x, y</I>, 0.0, 1.0)T.
<P>As long as <I>w</I> is nonzero, the homogeneous vertex (<I>x, y, z,
w</I>)T corresponds to the three-dimensional point (<I>x/w, y/w, z/w</I>)T.
If <I>w</I> = 0.0, it corresponds to no euclidean point, but rather to
some idealized "point at infinity." To understand this point at infinity,
consider the point (1, 2, 0, 0), and note that the sequence of points (1,
2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0, 0.01), and (1, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0001), corresponds to the
euclidean points (1, 2), (100, 200), and (10000, 20000). This sequence
represents points rapidly moving toward infinity along the line 2<I>x</I>
= <I>y</I>. Thus, you can think of (1, 2, 0, 0) as the point at infinity
in the direction of that line.
<P>OpenGL might not handle homogeneous clip coordinates with <I>w</I> &lt;
0 correctly. To be sure that your code is portable to all OpenGL systems,
use only nonnegative <I>w</I> values.
<H3>
Transforming Vertices</H3>
Vertex transformations (such as rotations, translations, scaling, and shearing)
and projections (such as perspective and orthographic) can all be represented
by applying an appropriate 4 × 4 matrix to the coordinates representing
the vertex. If <B>v</B> represents a homogeneous vertex, and <B>M</B> is
a 4 × 4 transformation matrix, then <B>Mv</B> is the image of <B>v</B>
under the transformation by <B>M</B>. (In computer-graphics applications,
the transformations used are usually nonsingular - in other words, the
matrix <B>M</B> can be inverted. This isn't required, but some problems
arise with nonsingular transformations.)
<P>&nbsp;After transformation, all transformed vertices are clipped so
that <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I> are in the range [-<I>w</I>, <I>w</I>]
(assuming <I>w</I> > 0). Note that this range corresponds in euclidean
space to [-1.0, 1.0].
<H3>
Transforming Normals</H3>
Normal vectors don't transform in the same way as vertices, or position
vectors. Mathematically, it's better to think of normal vectors not as
vectors, but as planes perpendicular to those vectors. Then, the transformation
rules for normal vectors are described by the transformation rules for
perpendicular planes.
<P>A homogeneous plane is denoted by the row vector (<I>a , b, c, d</I>),
where at least one of <I>a, b, c</I>, or <I>d</I> is nonzero. If <B>q</B>
is a nonzero real number, then (<I>a, b, c, d</I>) and (<I>qa, qb, qc,
qd</I>) represent the same plane. A point (<I>x, y, z, w</I>)T is on the
plane (<I>a, b, c, d</I>) if <I>ax</I>+<I>by</I>+<I>cz</I>+<I>dw</I> =
0. (If <I>w</I> = 1, this is the standard description of a euclidean plane.)
In order for (<I>a, b, c, d</I>) to represent a euclidean plane, at least
one of <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, or <I>c</I> must be nonzero. If they're all
zero, then (0, 0, 0, <I>d</I>) represents the "plane at infinity," which
contains all the "points at infinity."
<P>If <B>p</B> is a homogeneous plane and <B>v</B> is a homogeneous vertex,
then the statement "<B>v</B> lies on plane <B>p</B>" is written mathematically
as <B>pv</B> = 0, where <B>pv</B> is normal matrix multiplication. If <B>M</B>
is a nonsingular vertex transformation (that is, a 4 × 4 matrix that has
an inverse <B>M</B>-1), then <B>pv</B> = 0 is equivalent to <B>pM</B>-1<B>Mv</B>
= 0, so <B>Mv</B> lies on the plane <B>pM</B>-1. Thus, <B>pM</B>-1 is the
image of the plane under the vertex transformation <B>M</B>.
<P>If you like to think of normal vectors as vectors instead of as the
planes perpendicular to them, let <B>v</B> and <B>n</B> be vectors such
that <B>v</B> is perpendicular to <B>n</B>. Then, <B>n</B>T<B>v</B> = 0.
Thus, for an arbitrary nonsingular transformation <B>M</B>, <B>n</B>T<B>M</B>-1<B>Mv</B>
= 0, which means that nTM-1 is the transpose of the transformed normal
vector. Thus, the transformed normal vector is <B>(M</B>-1<B>)</B>T<B>n</B>.
In other words, normal vectors are transformed by the inverse transpose
of the transformation that transforms points. Whew!

Transformation Matrices</H2>
Although any nonsingular matrix <B>M</B> represents a valid projective
transformation, a few special matrices are particularly useful. These matrices
are listed in the following paragraphs.
<H3>
Translation</H3>
The call <B>glTranslate*</B>(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) generates <B>T</B>,
where:
<P><IMG SRC="figures/eqapg01.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" NOSAVE >
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Scaling</H3>
The call <B>glScale*</B>(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) generates <B>S</B>,
where:
<P><IMG SRC="figures/eqapg02.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" NOSAVE >
<P>Notice that <B>S</B>-1 is defined only if <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, and <I>z</I>
are all nonzero.
<H3>
Rotation</H3>
The call <B>glRotate*</B>(<I>a</I>, <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>) generates
<B>R</B> as follows.
<P>Let v = (<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>)T, and <B>u</B> = v/||v|| = (<I>x</I>',
<I>y</I>', <I>z</I>').
<P>Also let
<P><IMG SRC="figures/eqapg03.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" NOSAVE >
<P>Then
<P><IMG SRC="figures/eqapg04.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" NOSAVE >
<P>The <B>R</B> matrix is always defined. If <I>x=y=z</I>=0, then <B>R</B>
is the identity matrix. You can obtain the inverse of <B>R</B>, <B>R</B>-1,
by substituting -<B>a</B> for <B>a</B>, or by transposition.
<P>The <B>glRotate*()</B> command generates a matrix for rotation about
an arbitrary axis. Often, you're rotating about one of the coordinate axes;
the corresponding matrices are as follows.
<P><IMG SRC="figures/eqapg05.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" NOSAVE >
<P>As before, the inverses are obtained by transposition.
<H3>
Perspective Projection</H3>
The call <B>glFrustum</B>(<I>l</I>, <I>r</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>t</I>, <I>n</I>,
<I>f</I> ) generates <B>R</B>, where:
<P><IMG SRC="figures/eqapg06.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" NOSAVE >
<P><B>R</B> is defined as long as<B> l </B>not equal to<B> r</B>,<B> t
</B>not equal to<B> b</B>, and <B>n </B>not equal to<B> f</B>.
<H3>
Orthographic Projection</H3>
The call <B>glOrtho*(l, r, b, t, u, f )</B> generates <B>R</B>, where:
<P><IMG SRC="figures/eqapg07.gif" ALT="[IMAGE]" NOSAVE >
<P><B>R</B> is defined as long as<B> l </B>not equal to<B> r</B>, <B>t
</B>not equal to<B> b</B>, and <B>n </B>not equal to<B> f</B>.
